## INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the **#30daysduckdbchallenge**, an exciting journey of data exploration and analysis using DuckDB, a high-performance analytical database designed for fast SQL queries on large datasets. In this project, I delve into the world of FIFA 21 player dataset, cleaning and transforming the dataset, performing insightful analysis, and drawing valuable conclusions.

## DATASET
I utilized two datasets, [Fifa_21_RD1](https://github.com/AnietieJohnson/FIFA21-DATASET-ANALYSIS-DUCKDB-SQL-/blob/main/fifa21%20raw%20data1.csv) and [Fifa_21_RD2](https://github.com/AnietieJohnson/FIFA21-DATASET-ANALYSIS-DUCKDB-SQL-/blob/main/fifa21_raw_data2.csv), each containing FIFA 21 player information. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from these datasets and showcase the power of DuckDB as an analytical tool.
